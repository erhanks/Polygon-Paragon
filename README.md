I've made what essentially operates as a merge game where you click on matching shapes to make them into a bigger one. 
You need to combine as many shapes as the number says in the middle. For example, you need to combine 3 triangles to make a square, 4 squares to make a pentagon, etc.
It'll make more sense once you start up the game. I have a rules screen with a demonstration to help explain.
There is a little bit of lag between when you click on enough shapes and when they combine, just wait a half second and it'll work.

The file named "personal project" is the file with the game in it. The other file is the Portable Graphics Library module necessary for the personal project code to run.
