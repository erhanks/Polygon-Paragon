I've made what essentially operates as a merge game; you click on matching shapes to make them into a bigger one. 
You need to combine as many shapes as the number says in the middle; 
for example, you need to combine 3 triangles to make a square, 4 squares to make a pentagon, etc
It'll make a bit more sense once you start up the game; I have a rules screen with a demonstration.
There is a little bit of lag between when you click on enough shapes and when they combine, just wait a half second and it'll work
